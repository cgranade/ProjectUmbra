Project Umbra
=============

Introduction
============

This project aims to provide tools to ease the bookkeeping associated with playing table-top roleplaying games. As such, there are three main components that make up Project Umbra:

- **UmbraCommons**: Defines protocols and provides data models for various RPGs.
- **Shadowcloud**: Google App Engine based web service offering cloud-based persistence for gaming configurations, and providing a smartphone-oriented client for players.
- **Shadowtable**: Android Honeycomb based tablet app for managing games. Intended for use by GMs.

Status
======

Project Umbra is still in its inception, and as such, the current goals are significantly restricted from what I hope the project will become.
In particular, much of Project Umbra as it stands now is geared towards one particular RPG: Shadowrun 4e.
In the future, this should be broadened significantly, but that's how it stands for now.
